# 🌐 Computer Networks and Security Lab (CNSL) - TE Comp SPPU

Welcome to the **Computer Networks and Security Lab (CNSL)** repository for Third Year Computer Engineering students at **SPPU**! This repository contains the solutions and projects covered in the CNSL course.

## 📚 Course Overview
The **Computer Networks and Security Lab** provides hands-on experience with various networking concepts and security protocols. In this lab, students will explore:

- Network protocols 🖧
- Security techniques 🔐
- Socket programming 📡
- Encryption and decryption algorithms 🔒
- Firewall and VPN setups 🛡️
- Network topologies and configurations 🌍

## 🧪 Lab Assignments

1. **Socket Programming** 📝  
   Create a client-server model using TCP and UDP protocols.

2. **Packet Sniffing** 🔍  
   Analyze and capture network packets using tools like Wireshark.

3. **Network Security Algorithms** 🔑  
   Implement encryption (DES, AES) and hashing (SHA, MD5) algorithms.

4. **Firewall Configuration** 🛠️  
   Set up and configure firewalls using iptables.

5. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** 🌐  
   Set up a VPN and configure secure remote access.

6. **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)** 📂  
   Implement secure file transfers between systems.

## 💻 Software & Tools

- **Wireshark** for network packet analysis 🕵️
- **Netcat** for networking 🖧
- **OpenSSL** for encryption tasks 🔐
- **Linux iptables** for firewall configuration 🛡️
